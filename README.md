Metacritic is a website where many movie critics' voices are distilled into the single Metascore, a weighted average of the most respected critics writing reviews online and in print. Joker and Parasite are two recent movies in theatre, both are movie festival award-winning with high public score as well. However, Joker is having a significant lower Metascore as of today, 59 versus 95. Moreover, this score used to be more than 80 after it takes home Top Prize at Venice Film Festival. 
What might be the factors that drive the score to change this way? Do they apply to reviews and Metascore in general as well? Hope this project can shed some light on our perspective about Metascore, critic reviews, media and more.
